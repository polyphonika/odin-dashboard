Will have sub grids in sidebar, header and main.


### Actions
- [x] Create HTML boilerplate
- [x] Create scaffolding of sections but without child elements
- [x] Apply colours to those, see if works
- [x] Decide on page height
- [x] Get font details, build rules
- [x] Get SVGs, build rules
- [x] Get reset rules for LIs from gist
- [x] Build header bar in HTML
- [x] Apply basic styling to header
- [ ] Plan cards and general content section


### Notes
- How does page height work?
    - Set on body, then on container
- Name your grid areas
- Use variables for colours, sizes
- Consider minmax (or similar) on your sidebar so it doesn't get too wide
- Use utility classes where possible
- Use Powell container sizes, rems etc
- Use Powell resets
- Summarise all Powell rules
- SVGs and fill colours
- Lots to summarise from recent learnings
- Line height can trip you up, as well as default margins
- When you align center a field in grid, it does not stretch by default
- Watch Kevin Powell again for ideas and improving your skills, general resets, approach
